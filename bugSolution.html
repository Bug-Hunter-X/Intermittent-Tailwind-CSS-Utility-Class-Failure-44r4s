After considerable debugging, the root cause turned out to be an unexpected interaction between a custom plugin and Tailwind's purge process.  The plugin was inadvertently removing necessary CSS rules. The solution involved carefully reviewing the plugin's configuration and ensuring the necessary rules were explicitly whitelisted in the purge options within the `tailwind.config.js` file.  The `bugSolution.html` file illustrates the modified configuration and how this resolved the issue.  Note:  This solution might not be universally applicable; it's essential to examine your own plugins and purge configurations to pinpoint similar issues.
