I'm encountering an unexpected behavior in Tailwind CSS where a specific utility class isn't applying styles as expected.  I've checked the Tailwind configuration and the class name seems correct, but the styles aren't rendering.  This happens inconsistently across different components and elements. I've tried purging the CSS and restarting the development server, but the issue persists.  The browser's developer tools don't reveal any conflicting styles or errors.
